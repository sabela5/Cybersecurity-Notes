#### What is the MITRE ATT&CK framework?

[[Is like a big guidebook that shows how cyber attackers operate and what they do at each step of their attacks. It helps organizations understand and defend against cyber threats.]][[**TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) are a key part of the **MITRE ATT&CK framework**, which is used to understand and analyze adversary behavior.**]]


#### 3, What is shared responsibility in the context of cybersecurity?
[[means that both you and the service provider (like a cloud company or IT system) work together to keep things secure.]]

#### What is the difference in shared responsibility for security controls between IaaS, PaaS and SaaS?
**1, IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service)**: you secure the most 
	[[ The CSP (cloud service provider) provides the foundational infrastructure (servers, networking, storage), while the customer is responsible for managing the operating systems, applications, and security configurations on that infrastructure.]]
**2, PaaS (Platform as a Service)**:secure less(on apps and data)
	- [[The CSP offers a platform on which customers can build and deploy applications.]]
**3, SaaS (Software as a Service)**: u secure least (mainly ur usage n data)
	- [[The CSP provides fully functional applications accessible over the internet]]


#### N.B A **security baseline** and a **security guideline** are not the same:

- **Baseline**: A minimum set of security requirements that must be implemented. Itâ€™s mandatory and specific.
- **Guideline**: provides suggestions for improving it beyond the baseline.
