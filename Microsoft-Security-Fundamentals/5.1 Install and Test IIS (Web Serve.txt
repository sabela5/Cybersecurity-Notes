5.1 Install and Test IIS (Web Server)
5.1.1 Install IIS on VM1
Open Server Manager:

Launch Server Manager on VM1.
Add Roles and Features Wizard:

In the Server Manager dashboard, click Add Roles and Features.
Select Role-based or feature-based installation, then click Next.
Choose the local server (VM1), then click Next.
Select Web Server (IIS):

Under Server Roles, check Web Server (IIS).
Confirm the default features and dependencies, and click Next.
Install IIS:

Accept the defaults for IIS settings and click Install.
Wait for the installation to complete, then close the wizard.
5.1.2 Test IIS
Find VM1’s IP Address:

Open Command Prompt on VM1 and type ipconfig to find the IPv4 address (e.g., 192.168.1.10).
Access IIS from VM2:

On VM2, open a web browser (e.g., Microsoft Edge or Chrome).
Enter the URL: http://192.168.1.10.
If IIS is configured correctly, you should see the default IIS welcome page.
Troubleshooting:

If the page doesn't load, check the Windows Firewall settings on VM1 and allow inbound traffic for HTTP (port 80).
5.2 Configure DNS
5.2.1 Verify the Default DNS Zone
Open DNS Manager:

On VM1, open DNS Manager via the Server Manager or by typing dnsmgmt.msc in the Run dialog.
Check the Zone:

Expand the Forward Lookup Zones in the left panel.
Confirm that the example.local zone exists (it should have been created during the Active Directory setup).
5.2.2 Add a Forward Lookup Record
Create a Host (A) Record:
Right-click the example.local zone and select New Host (A or AAAA).
Enter:
Name: www
IP Address: 192.168.1.10 (the IP of VM1 where IIS is running)
Click Add Host to save the record.
5.2.3 Test DNS Resolution
Edit the Hosts File (if necessary):

If DNS resolution doesn't work automatically, edit the hosts file on VM2:
Open Notepad as an administrator.
Edit the file: C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc\hosts.
Add the following line:
lua
Copy code
192.168.1.10    www.example.local
Test in a Browser:

Open a browser on VM2 and type: http://www.example.local.
You should see the default IIS page. This confirms DNS is correctly resolving the name.
Troubleshooting:

If DNS doesn't work:
Ensure VM2 is using the Domain Controller (VM1) as its primary DNS server.
Verify that the www.example.local record exists in DNS Manager.
5.3 Install and Configure DHCP
5.3.1 Install DHCP Server Role
Add Roles and Features:

In Server Manager on VM1, click Add Roles and Features.
Select DHCP Server, then click Next.
Configure DHCP Settings:

After installation, complete the DHCP Post-Install configuration by opening the DHCP console from Server Manager.
Create a New Scope:

In the DHCP Manager:
Right-click IPv4 and select New Scope.
Follow the wizard to configure:
Scope Name: ExampleScope
IP Range: 192.168.1.100 to 192.168.1.200
Subnet Mask: 255.255.255.0
Default Gateway: Enter the IP address of VM1 (192.168.1.1, if acting as a gateway).
DNS Server: Enter the IP of VM1 (192.168.1.10).
Activate the Scope:

After configuration, right-click the scope and select Activate.
5.3.2 Test DHCP
Change VM2’s IP Configuration:

On VM2, go to Network and Sharing Center > Change adapter settings.
Right-click the network adapter, select Properties.
Double-click Internet Protocol Version 4 (TCP/IPv4).
Select Obtain an IP address automatically and Obtain DNS server address automatically.
Save the settings.
Verify the IP Assignment:

Open Command Prompt on VM2 and type ipconfig.
Confirm that VM2 receives an IP address from the DHCP scope (e.g., 192.168.1.101).
Troubleshooting:

If VM2 doesn't get an IP:
Ensure VM1 and VM2 are on the same network.
Verify the DHCP service is running on VM1 (services.msc > DHCP Server).
By completing these steps, IIS, DNS, and DHCP will be installed and configured on VM1, with their functionality verified from VM2.
