#NB AI security involves the application and protection of artificial intelligence systems to enhance cybersecurity and safeguard AI technologies from threats.

### **Key Threats in AI Security**:

- **Data Poisoning**:
    - Attackers insert malicious or misleading data into training datasets to manipulate AI models.
- **Adversarial Attacks**:
    - Slightly altered inputs that deceive AI systems, such as bypassing facial recognition or spam filters.
- **Model Theft**:
    - Unauthorized access to proprietary AI models, allowing attackers to replicate or exploit them.
- **Privacy Breaches**:
    - Extracting sensitive information from AI models or datasets.
    
- ### **AI Security Applications**:

- **User Behavior Analytics (UBA)**:
    - Tracks user activity to detect anomalies or insider threats.
- **Fraud Detection**:
    - Identifies fraudulent activities in banking, e-commerce, and insurance using predictive models.
- **Endpoint Security**:
    - Enhances protection on devices using AI-based malware detection and real-time monitoring.
- **Threat Hunting**:
    - Automates proactive search for emerging threats within an organizationâ€™s environment.
