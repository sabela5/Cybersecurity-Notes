Infrastructure security focuses on protecting **IT infrastructure** (networks, servers, data centers, devices, etc.) from cyber threats. Here are the **key concepts**:

## What is security hygiene and why is it important?

**Security hygiene** refers to the set of **regular practices, processes, and habits** that organizations and individuals follow to maintain a secure and healthy cybersecurity posture.

Good security hygiene is important for several reasons:
- **Preventing Attacks**:
- **Protecting Data**
- **Maintaining Trust**
- **Compliance**
- **Reducing Risk**
Security hygiene is the **foundation of cybersecurity**. By following simple, consistent practices like patching, backups, and access management, organizations and individuals can **prevent many common attacks** and strengthen their overall security posture. It is a proactive approach to reducing risks and maintaining a safe, reliable IT environment.

## What is patching and why is it important?

**Patching** is the process of applying updates to software, operating systems, or firmware to fix **security vulnerabilities, bugs, or performance issues**.

Why is Patching Important?
- **Security**
- **Stability**
- **Compliance**
- **Maintaining Trust**
- **Risk Reduction**
### **Types of Patching**

1. **Operating System Patching**:
    
    - Updates to Windows, Linux, or macOS to fix vulnerabilities.
2. **Application Patching**:
    
    - Updates for software like web browsers, office tools, and productivity applications.
3. **Firmware Patching**:
    
    - Updates for hardware components, such as routers, IoT devices, and servers.
4. **Third-Party Library Patching**:
    
    - Fixing vulnerabilities in libraries and dependencies used by applications.



### **What are Containers?**

**Containers** are lightweight, portable units that package an application and its dependencies (libraries, configurations, and binaries) together. Containers ensure the application runs consistently across different computing environments, whether on a developer's laptop, a testing server, or in production.

**Key Features of Containers:**

- **Isolation**: Each container operates independently, isolated from others on the same host system.
- **Lightweight**: Containers share the host operating system kernel, unlike traditional virtual machines (VMs).
- **Portability**: Containers can run consistently across different platforms (e.g., Docker, Kubernetes).
- **Scalability**: Containers can be quickly started, stopped, and scaled up or down.
