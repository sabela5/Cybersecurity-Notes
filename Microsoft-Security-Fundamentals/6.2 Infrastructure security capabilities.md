### **What is Vulnerability Management?**

**Vulnerability Management** is the continuous process of identifying, assessing, prioritizing, mitigating, and monitoring security vulnerabilities within systems, software, and networks. It ensures organizations proactively address weaknesses before attackers can exploit them.
#NB - **Vulnerability Management**: Focuses on identifying, assessing, and fixing **software vulnerabilities** (flaws, bugs, or outdated systems) across all IT systems, including **on-premises, cloud, and hybrid infrastructures**.
### **Common Tools for Vulnerability Management**

1. **Nessus** – Vulnerability scanning and assessment.
2. **Qualys VMDR** – Cloud-based vulnerability management.
3. **Rapid7 InsightVM** – Integrated vulnerability management.
4. **OpenVAS** – Open-source vulnerability scanning.
5. **Tenable.io** – Continuous vulnerability monitoring.

## What is CSPM(Cloud Security Posture Management)?

is a set of tools and practices that help organizations **identify, monitor, and remediate security risks** and misconfigurations in their cloud environments.
#NB **CSPM**: Focuses on identifying and remediating **misconfigurations and policy violations** in cloud environments (AWS, Azure, GCP, etc.).

### **Popular CSPM Tools**

1. **Palo Alto Prisma Cloud**
2. **Wiz**
3. **Check Point CloudGuard**
4. **AWS Security Hub**
5. **Microsoft Defender for Cloud**
6. **Trend Micro Cloud One**


## What is CNAPP(Cloud-Native Application Protection Platform)?

**CNAPP** is a tool that protects cloud-based applications **from start to finish** — during development, deployment, and while they are running. It combines multiple security features into **one platform**, making it easier to secure modern cloud apps..

### **Why CNAPP is Important**

Cloud-native applications use technologies like containers, Kubernetes, and serverless functions. These are powerful but also complex, making them harder to secure. CNAPP simplifies this by providing **everything you need for cloud security** in one place.

What Does CNAPP Do? (Key Features)

1. Fix Cloud Misconfigurations (CSPM)
2. Find Vulnerabilities
3. Secure Containers:   Protects container-based apps (like those in Docker and Kubernetes) by checking for:

	- Vulnerabilities in container images.
	- Misconfigurations or unusual activity.
4. Real-Time Protection
5. Check Code Before Deployment
### **Why CNAPP is Better**

- Combines multiple tools (CSPM, container security, vulnerability scanning, runtime protection) into **one platform**.
- Provides a **complete view** of security across the entire app lifecycle.
- Reduces complexity and saves time.
### **Popular CNAPP Tools**

- **Prisma Cloud** (Palo Alto Networks)
- **Wiz**
- **Microsoft Defender for Cloud**
- **Trend Micro Cloud One**
- **Lacework**
