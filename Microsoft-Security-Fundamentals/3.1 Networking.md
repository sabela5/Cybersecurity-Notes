## What is IP addressing(Internet Protocol)?
 is a numerical label assigned to every device connected to a computer network that uses the Internet Protocol for communication.

## What is the <span style="color:red">OSI (Open system Interconnection)Model?</span>
is a framework that explains how data travels from one device to another over a network. It breaks down the communication process into ***seven layers***, making it easier to understand and troubleshoot
1. Physical Layer
    
2. Data Link Layer
    
3. Network Layer
    
4. Transport Layer
    
5. Session Layer
    
6. Presentation Layer
    
7. Application Layer

## What is TCP/UDP?

[[TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) and UDP (User Datagram Protocol) are two fundamental transport layer protocols used in computer networks to facilitate the communication between devices over the internet or within a local network]]

- ***TCP*** = Reliable and accurate, but slower.
- ***UDP*** = Fast but can lose or mix up data.

## What are Port Numbers?
Are like "doors" through which data enters or leaves a computer in a network.
### **How It Works:**

- **IP Address**: Identifies the device on the network.
- **Port Number**: Specifies the application or service on that device.
### **Types of Ports:**

1. **Well-Known Ports**: Numbers **0–1023** are reserved for common services like:
    
    - **HTTP (Web)**: Port 80
    - **HTTPS (Secure Web)**: Port 443
    - **FTP (File Transfer)**: Port 21
2. **Registered Ports**: Numbers **1024–49151** are assigned to specific applications or companies.
    
3. **Dynamic/Private Ports**: Numbers **49152–65535** are used temporarily by apps when communicating
### <span style="color:red">**Why Port Numbers?**</span>
They allow devices to handle multiple types of network traffic.

## What is encryption at rest?
means protecting data stored on a device (like a hard drive, server, or cloud storage) by encoding it into a secure format.
### **Why it’s important:**

- Protects sensitive data (e.g., financial records, personal details) from being exposed in case of theft or unauthorized access.
