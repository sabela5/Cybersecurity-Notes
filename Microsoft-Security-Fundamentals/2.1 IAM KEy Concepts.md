Identity and Access Management controls who can log in, what they can access, and ensures secure and efficient user management.
## principle of least privilege?
**(PoLP)** means giving a person or system **only the access and permissions they absolutely need to do their job**—nothing more.

## What is authentication 
something that you ***(Know, have, are)***
and authorization?

## What is a directory service?
[[A directory service is a specialized database that stores and manages information about network resources, including users, groups, devices, applications, and other objects.]]

### <span style=color:red> Active Directory:</span>
is a set of directory services developed by Microsoft as part of Windows 2000 for on-premises domain-based networks.<span style= color:yellow> Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS)</span> stores information about members of the domain, including devices and users, verifies their credentials, and defines their access rights.
###### Key functions and features of a directory service in the context of cybersecurity include:
**User Authentication**:
**User Authorization**
**Group Management**:
**Password Policies**:

## <span style=color:red> **Microsoft Entra ID**</span>

**Microsoft Entra ID**, formerly known as <span style=color:yellow> **Azure Active Directory (Azure AD)**,</span> is a cloud-based identity and access management (IAM) service provided by Microsoft. 
Microsoft Entra ID is an example of <span style=color:yellow> a cloud-based identity provider</span>. Other examples include Google, Amazon, LinkedIn, and GitHub.

**A:** **Microsoft Entra ID (Azure AD)** is Microsoft’s cloud-based identity and access management solution that enables:

- **Single Sign-On (SSO)**
- **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**
- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**
- **Conditional Access policies**
**A:** **Conditional Access** is a feature that applies policies based on conditions such as:

- **User identity**
- **Device security status**
- **Location**
- **Application being accessed**
### **Microsoft Entra ID License Options**

1. **Microsoft Entra ID Free**: This is the most basic tier and is suitable for small businesses or individual users who need minimal identity and access management features.
2. **Microsoft Entra ID P1 (Premium Plan 1: provides enhanced identity and access management features, including hybrid identity solutions and conditional access.
3. **Microsoft Entra ID P2 (Premium Plan 2)**: all the features of P1 and adds advanced identity protection and governance capabilities for larger or more security-conscious organizations.
4. **Microsoft Entra External ID**
5. **Microsoft Entra Workload ID**
6. **Other Microsoft 365-Integrated Licensing**

## **Identity Types in Microsoft Entra ID**

### **1. User Identities**

- Represent human users who sign in to access resources.
- Can be categorized as:
    - **Cloud-Only Users** – Created directly in Entra ID.
    - **Hybrid Users** – Synced from an on-premises **Active Directory** (via Microsoft Entra Connect).
    - **Guest Users (External Identities)** – External users (e.g., partners, contractors) invited to collaborate.
### **2. Service Principal (SP) Identities**

- Used by applications to authenticate and access resources securely.
- Essential for **OAuth 2.0** and API authentication scenarios.

### **3. Managed Identities**

- A special type of identity automatically managed by Entra ID to enable secure authentication for **Azure resources** (e.g., virtual machines, functions, and containers) <span style=color:yellow>without storing credentials</span>.

### **4. Device Identities**

- Represents devices that are registered and joined to Microsoft Entra ID.
- Includes:
    - **Azure AD Registered Devices** – Personal devices using Microsoft Entra ID for authentication.
    - **Azure AD Joined Devices** – Organization-owned devices fully managed via Entra ID.
    - **Hybrid Azure AD Joined Devices** – On-premises AD-joined devices linked to Entra ID.

### **5. Workload Identities**

- Used for **non-human** identities like applications, services, and automation workflows.
- Helps manage access for scripts, bots, or AI models.
-
**2 Microsoft Entra ID P1 (Premium Plan 1)**: 
<span style=color:yellow>**Single Sign-On (SSO)**</span>:[[Some directory services support SSO, enabling users to access multiple applications and services with a single set of credentials.]]
**Centralized User Management**:
**Auditing and Logging**:
	#NB When you set up SSO between <span style=color:yellow>multiple identity providers,</span> it's called <span style=color:yellow>federation.</span>

Questions 
1. Which feature is only available in Microsoft Defender for Office 365 Plan 2? #ANS Attack Simulator
2. Q4: Your company has an on-premises Active Directory (AD) and wants to sync user accounts with Microsoft Entra ID to enable cloud authentication. However, passwords should **remain on-premises** while users can authenticate to cloud apps. Which authentication method should you choose?
		✅ **Correct Answer:** **B** - **Pass-through Authentication (PTA)** allows users to authenticate using on-prem AD credentials without syncing passwords to the cloud. **AD FS (D)** is another valid option but requires more infrastructure.

1. <span style=color:yellow>Managed identities</span> are a type of service principal that are automatically managed in Microsoft Entra ID and eliminate the need for developers to manage credentials.

# 2.2 Describe the authentication caabilities of Microsoft Entra ID


# authentication methods
##### 1. Password-Based Authentication:  traditional password
##### 2. **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**
   - Phone based SMS and Voice call verification
   - Authenticator App (Microsoft Authenticator): The app provides push notifications for approval and can also be used for passwordless sign-in.
   -  OATH(Open Authentication ): Only supported as <span style=color:yellow>secondary forms of authentication in Microsoft Entra ID</span>, to verify an identity during self-service password reset (SSPR) or Microsoft Entra multifactor authentication. It implements using  Software OATH tokens and **OATH TOTP hardware tokens** (supported in public preview)
##### 3. **Passwordless Authentication**
- Windows Hello: is Microsoft’s <span style=color:yellow>biometric </span>and <span style=color:yellow>PIN-based authentication system</span> built into Windows 10 and later.
 - FIDO2 (Fast Identity Online: is an open standard for passwordless authentication.
	-> As a passwordless authentication method, FIDO2 serves as a <span style=color:yellow>primary</span>. form of authentication. In addition, FIDO2 can be used as a <span style=color:yellow>secondary</span> form of authentication to verify an identity during multifactor authentication.
- **Microsoft Authenticator (Passwordless Mode):** Besides MFA, the app also supports a fully passwordless experience where the user confirms their identity through a notification.
##### 4.  Certificate-Based Authentication (CBA)
 - **Digital Certificates and Smart Card**
 ##### 5. Temporary and Additional Methods
	 - Temporary Access Pass (TAP):


Q&A 

 1. Sign-in risk is a signal used by Conditional Access policies to decide whether to grant or deny access. What is sign-in risk? #ANS is the real-time calculation that a given authentication request isn't authorized by the identity owner.


# 2.4 Describe main points of the identity protection and governance capabilities of Microsoft Entra


**Identity Protection:**

- ==**Risk Detection & Remediation:**== Monitors sign-ins and behaviors to detect anomalies and automatically trigger actions (like MFA) to mitigate risks.
- ==**Conditional Access:** ==Applies adaptive policies based on risk factors to balance security with user productivity. It is a security mechanism that evaluates conditions—like user location, device compliance, and risk levels—before granting access to resources.

**Identity Governance:**

- ==**Access Reviews:** ==Regularly verifies that users have appropriate permissions, removing unnecessary access.
- ==**Entitlement Management:** ==Automates provisioning and revocation of access rights to enforce least privilege.
- ==**Privileged Identity Management (PIM):**== Controls, audits, and monitors elevated access through just-in-time access and approval workflows.
