#### What is the MITRE ATT&CK framework?

[[Is like a big guidebook that shows how cyber attackers operate and what they do at each step of their attacks. It helps organizations understand and defend against cyber threats.]][[**TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) are a key part of the **MITRE ATT&CK framework**, which is used to understand and analyze adversary behavior.**]]


#### 3, What is shared responsibility in the context of cybersecurity?
[[means that both you and the service provider (like a cloud company or IT system) work together to keep things secure.]]

#### What is the difference in shared responsibility for security controls between IaaS, PaaS and SaaS?
**1, IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service)**: you secure the most 
	[[ The CSP (cloud service provider) provides the foundational infrastructure (servers, networking, storage), while the customer is responsible for managing the operating systems, applications, and security configurations on that infrastructure.]]
	Examples 
	1. **Amazon Web Services (AWS)** EC2
    - Elastic compute instances for running applications.
	2. **Microsoft Azure Virtual Machines**
    - Cloud-based virtual servers.
	3. **Google Cloud Compute Engine**
    - Scalable virtual machines in the cloud.
	4. **IBM Cloud Infrastructure**
    - Bare metal servers and cloud infrastructure solutions.
	5. **DigitalOcean**
    - Simple and scalable cloud infrastructure for developers.
**2, PaaS (Platform as a Service)**:secure less(on apps and data)
	- [[The CSP offers a platform on which customers can build and deploy applications.]]
	- #### Examples:

1. **Google App Engine**
    - Platform for building and hosting web applications.
2. **Microsoft Azure App Service**
    - Platform for building, deploying, and scaling web apps and APIs.
3. **Heroku**
    - A developer-friendly platform for deploying and managing applications.
4. **AWS Elastic Beanstalk**
    - Service for deploying and scaling web applications.
5. **Red Hat OpenShift**
    - Enterprise-grade container orchestration and application platform.
**3, SaaS (Software as a Service)**: u secure least (mainly ur usage n data)
	- [[The CSP provides fully functional applications accessible over the internet]]

#### Examples:

1. **Google Workspace** (Google Docs, Gmail, Google Drive)
    - Cloud-based tools for productivity and collaboration.
2. **Microsoft 365** (Word, Excel, Outlook)
    - Office applications accessible via the cloud.
3. **Dropbox**
    - Cloud-based file storage and sharing.
4. **Slack**
    - Team communication and collaboration platform.
5. **Zoom**
    - Video conferencing and online meetings.
#### N.B A **security baseline** and a **security guideline** are not the same:

- **Baseline**: A minimum set of security requirements that must be implemented. Itâ€™s mandatory and specific.
- **Guideline**: provides suggestions for improving it beyond the baseline.


Questions 
1. In the shared security model, which responsibilities are retained by customers when hosting infrastructure as a service (IaaS) virtual machines? #ANS Operating system
2. ==Authorization== is responsible for determining which level of access authenticated users have. 
3. ==Administration== is responsible for managing user accounts.
4. Which identity provider allows you to use software as a service (SaaS) and platform as a service (PaaS) in Azure with the least administrative effort? #ANS Microsoft Entra ID
		-> Microsoft Entra ID can be used without the need for domain controller servers.
