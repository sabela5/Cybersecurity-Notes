# Describe encryption and hashing

There are #two top-level types of encryption: 
1. Symmetric encryption uses the same key to encrypt and decrypt the data.
2. Asymmetric encryption uses a public key and private key pair.

## Hashing

Hashing uses an algorithm to convert text to a _unique_ fixed-length value called a hash.
