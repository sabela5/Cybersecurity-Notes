**(AppSec)** focuses on securing applications by identifying, addressing, and mitigating vulnerabilities throughout the software development lifecycle (SDLC)

## principles of application security?

#NB By following these principles, you can reduce risks, build stronger applications, and protect sensitive data from attackers. **Security should always be part of the application design, not added later.**

1. **Secure by Design**:
2. **Input Validation**:
3.  **Output Encoding**:
4.  **Authentication and Authorization**:
5. **Data Protection**
6.  **Session Management**:
7.  **Secure Dependencies**:
8.  **Error Handling and Logging**:
9.  **Security Testing**
10. **Secure Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC)**
