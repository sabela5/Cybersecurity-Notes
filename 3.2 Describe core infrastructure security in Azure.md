## Distributed Denial of Service <span style=color:yellow> (DDoS)</span> attacks
is a malicious attempt to disrupt the normal functioning of a targeted server, service, or network by overwhelming it with a flood of internet traffic.

### How DDoS Attacks Work

1. **Botnets**: Attackers often use a network of compromised devices (botnets), which can include computers, IoT devices, and servers infected with malware. These devices are controlled remotely.
2. **Traffic Flooding**: The botnet sends a large volume of requests or data packets to the target, overwhelming its resources and rendering it unable to serve legitimate users.
3. **Target Exhaustion**: The attack aims to exhaust critical resources like bandwidth, memory, or processing power.

### Types of DDoS Attacks

1. **Volume-Based Attacks**:
    
    - Aim to saturate the target's bandwidth.
    - Examples: UDP floods, ICMP floods.
2. **Protocol Attacks**:
    
    - Exploit vulnerabilities in network protocols.
    - Examples: SYN floods, Ping of Death, Smurf attacks.
3. **Application-Layer Attacks**:
    
    - Target specific applications or services.
    - Examples: HTTP floods, Slowloris


### Symptoms of a DDoS Attack

- Slow network performance.
- Unavailability of a website or service.
- Increased load times or frequent timeouts.
- Sudden spikes in network traffic.
-

### DDoS Mitigation Strategies

- **Traffic Filtering**:
- **Rate Limiting**:
	    Limit the number of requests a server accepts from a single IP in a given timeframe.
- **Load Balancing**:
- **Scrubbing Centers**:
         Redirect traffic through scrubbing centers that analyze and remove malicious packets.
- **Cloud-Based Protection**:
		 Use cloud-based DDoS mitigation services like Cloudflare, AWS Shield, or Akamai.
- **Regular Updates and Patching**:

# Describe Azure Firewall

#FireWall is a security device, either hardware, software, or a combination of both, that monitors and controls incoming and outgoing network traffic based on predetermined security rules.

Azure Firewall is a managed, cloud-based network security service that provides threat protection for your cloud workloads and resources running in Azure.

### Key features of Azure Firewall

1. **Network Traffic Filtering**:
    
    - Controls both inbound and outbound traffic based on rules.
    - Supports filtering rules by IP addresses, ports, and protocols.
2. **Application Layer Filtering**:
    
    - Allows you to create rules based on fully qualified domain names (FQDNs), such as filtering web traffic by URL.
3. **Threat Intelligence**:
    
    - Uses Microsoft's threat intelligence to allow or deny traffic based on known malicious IPs or domains.
4. **Built-In High Availability**:
    
    - Azure Firewall is automatically scalable and highly available without requiring additional configuration.
5. **Integration with Azure Services**:
    
    - Seamlessly integrates with other Azure services like Azure Monitor, Azure Sentinel, and Azure Security Center for logging, monitoring, and analysis.
6. **Support for Multiple Network Protocols**:
    
    - Filters traffic across TCP, UDP, ICMP, and HTTP/S.
7. **Hub-Spoke Architecture**:
    
    - Can act as a central security control point in a hub-spoke network topology.
8. **Azure Firewall Manager**:
    
    - Provides centralized management for multiple firewalls, policies, and Secure Virtual Hubs.
9. **SSL Termination**:
    
    - Decrypts and inspects encrypted traffic (preview feature).

# Describe Web Application Firewall <span style=color:yellow>(WAF)</span>

**is a specialized firewall that protects web applications from online threats by filtering, monitoring, and blocking malicious traffic targeting web apps.**


How a WAF Works (Simplified)

1. **Analyzing HTTP/HTTPS Traffic**:
2. **Applying Rules**:
3. **Blocking Threats**:

Common  <span style=color:yellow>Threats a WAF Protects</span> Against:

1. **SQL Injection**:
2. **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**:
3. **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)**:
4. **File Inclusion Attacks**:
5. <span style=color:yellow>**Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS)** (in some WAFs):</span> While Azure DDoS Protection services protect customers against DDoS attacks that can occur at the network and transport layers, Azure WAF protects web applications against application-layer DDoS attacks, such as HTTP Floods.

# Describe Azure Network Security Groups <span style=color:yellow>(NSGs)</span>

NSGs) let you <span style=color:yellow> filter network traffic </span>to and from Azure resources in an Azure virtual network; for example, a virtual machine

Azure Network Security Groups (NSGs) have **default inbound rules** that control the behavior of incoming traffic.

Default Inbound Rules

1. Allow VNet Inbound
	- **Purpose**: This rule allows resources within the same Virtual Network (VNet) to communicate with each other without restriction.

	- **Why it's useful**: Enables communication between resources in the same VNet, such as VMs and application tiers.
		
2.  **Allow Azure Load Balancer**

- **Purpose**: This rule allows health probe traffic from Azure Load Balancers to reach your resources, ensuring they remain available and responsive.
- **Why it's useful**: Ensures that Azure Load Balancers can perform health checks on your resources to determine their availability.
-
3.  **Deny All Inbound**

- **Purpose**: Denies any other incoming traffic that doesnâ€™t match a higher-priority rule. 



### What is the difference between Network Security Groups (NSGs) and Azure Firewall?

### **Purpose**

- **NSGs**:
    
    - NSGs control traffic **within a virtual network** and are used to allow or deny traffic to/from Azure resources at the **network level**.
    - They are primarily designed for **basic filtering** based on IP addresses, ports, and protocols.
- **Azure Firewall**:
    
    - Azure Firewall is a **managed network security service** that provides broader protection at the **application and network levels**.
    - It offers advanced features like **application filtering**, **TLS inspection**, and **threat intelligence**.
# Describe Azure Bastion

**Azure Bastion** is a managed service in Microsoft Azure that provides **secure and seamless remote access** to virtual machines (VMs) directly through the Azure portal, without requiring a public IP address or exposing the VM to the internet. It acts as a jump box or gateway, enabling you to connect to your VMs using Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) and Secure Shell Protocol (SSH) over a secure connection.

#NB?An organization has several virtual machines in Azure. The security admin wants to deploy Azure Bastion to get secure access to those VMs. What should the admin keep in mind? #ANS= **Azure Bastion is deployed per virtual network, with support for virtual network peering.**


#NB How can application developers benefit from using <span style=color:yellow>Azure Key Vault?</span>


Azure Key Vault is a cloud service that helps application developers manage secrets, encryption keys, and certificates securely. It allows developers to focus on coding without worrying about securely storing sensitive information in their application.
