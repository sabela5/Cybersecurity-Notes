**Security Operations (SecOps)** refers to the processes, practices, and teams responsible for monitoring, managing, and protecting an organization’s digital assets, networks, systems, and data from cyber threats.

### Key Components of Security Operations

**1, Security Operations Center (SOC)**: 
Operates 24/7 in many organizations to detect and respond to threats in real-time.

**2. Threat Monitoring**:
    - Continuous monitoring of network traffic, systems, and logs to identify suspicious activities or potential threats.

**4. Incident Detection and Response**:

- Quickly identifying security incidents and responding to them to minimize damage and downtime. They conduct investigations, coordinate response efforts, and facilitate recovery.

**5. Threat Intelligence**:

- Gathering and analyzing information about potential and existing threats (e.g., malware trends, attack vectors).

**6. Security Information and Event Management (SIEM)**:

- Tools and platforms that aggregate security data from various sources, analyze it, and generate alerts for potential threats.
**7. Red Team/Blue Team:** 
The red team simulates attacks to identify vulnerabilities, while the blue team defends against those attacks.
